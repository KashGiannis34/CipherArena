Cipher Arena is a fast-paced multiplayer web app where players compete in real-time to solve cryptograms. Built with SvelteKit and Socket.IO, the platform supports classic cipher types like Aristocrat, Patristocrat, Caesar, Affine, Porta, and even Baconian â€” all while tracking rankings, stats, and speed-based achievements.

## Game Mechanics

- Rematches require **unanimous consent** â€” the game won't restart unless all players agree.
- **Live progress mapping** shows how much of the cipher each player has solved.
- Hosts can kick inactive players before the game starts.
- Socket reconnection is handled cleanly with session preservation and stale socket cleanup.
