Visit Site: [https://cipher-arena.fly.dev](https://cipher-arena.fly.dev)

Cipher Arena is a fast-paced multiplayer web app where players compete in real-time to solve cryptograms. Built with SvelteKit and Socket.IO, the platform supports classic cipher types like Aristocrat, Patristocrat, Caesar, Affine, Porta, Baconian, etc. The website also tracks rankings, stats, and speed-based achievements.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Battles** – Go head-to-head solving ciphers with real-time progress tracking.
- **Ranked Elo System** – Per-cipher ELO ratings with dynamic updates after every match.
- **Achievements & Badges** – Unlock unique badges based on obscure solve conditions and personal milestones (including nods to #34).
- **Secure Auth** – JWT-based login with email-first autofill and profile picture cropping.
- **Live Lobby System** – Discover and join public lobbies with real-time player lists and cipher metadata.
- **Leaderboards** – Filter by cipher type and performance metric (Elo, win %, best time, avg time per char, etc.).
- **Glassmorphic UI** – Responsive and animated UI built with Svelte 5 and runes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit
- **Backend**: Node.js, Socket.IO, MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Deployment**: Fly.io (with custom EC2 proxy to access MongoDB Atlas)
- **Auth & Storage**: JWT, AWS S3 for profile pictures

| Patristocrat   | Substitution cipher with spacing   |
| Caesar         | Classic letter-shifting cipher     |
| Affine         | Linear transformation cipher       |
| Porta          | Polyalphabetic cipher with table   |
| Baconian       | Binary-style encoding with rules   |
| Atbash         | Letter reversal substitution       |
| Nihilist       | Numeric key cipher                 |
| Xenocrypt      | Spanish Substitution cipher        |
| Hill           | Matrix algebra based cipher        |

## Game Mechanics

- Rematches require **unanimous consent** — the game won't restart unless all players agree.
- **Live progress mapping** shows how much of the cipher each player has solved.
- Hosts can kick inactive players before the game starts.
- Socket reconnection is handled cleanly with session preservation and stale socket cleanup.
